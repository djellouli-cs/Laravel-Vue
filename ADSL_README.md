# ADSL Management System

## Overview
The ADSL functionality has been successfully integrated into your Laravel + Inertia.js + Vue.js application. This system allows you to manage ADSL internet services and their billing information.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Database Changes
- **Extended `factures` table** with ADSL-specific fields:
  - `adsl_provider` - Internet service provider (Algerie Telecom or Mobilis)
  - `adsl_plan` - Service plan name/speed
  - `adsl_monthly_cost` - Monthly subscription cost in Algerian Dinar (DA)
  - `adsl_start_date` - Service start date
  - `adsl_end_date` - Service end date (optional)
  - `is_adsl` - Boolean flag to identify ADSL factures
  - `adsl_notes` - Additional notes

### ✅ Backend (Laravel)
- **Migration**: `2025_08_02_180000_add_adsl_fields_to_factures_table.php`
- **Model Updates**: Enhanced `Facture` model with:
  - New fillable fields
  - Proper data casting
  - Helper methods and scopes
- **Controller**: `AdslController` with full CRUD operations
- **Routes**: Complete RESTful API endpoints

### ✅ Frontend (Vue.js + Inertia.js)
- **Component**: `AdslManagement.vue` with modern UI
- **Features**:
  - Statistics dashboard
  - Create/Edit/Delete ADSL services
  - Provider filtering
  - Cost calculations
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Usage

### Accessing ADSL Management
1. Navigate to your application
2. Click on the "ADSL" link in the navigation bar
3. You'll see the ADSL management dashboard

### Creating an ADSL Service
1. Click "Add ADSL Service" button
2. Fill in the required information:
   - **NDappel**: The phone number identifier
   - **Provider**: Select from dropdown (Algerie Telecom or Mobilis)
   - **Plan**: Enter plan details (e.g., "Fibre 100Mbps")
   - **Monthly Cost**: Enter the monthly subscription cost in Algerian Dinar (DA)
   - **Start Date**: When the service started
   - **End Date**: Optional - when service ends
   - **Notes**: Additional information
3. Click "Create"

### Managing ADSL Services
- **View**: All ADSL services are displayed in a table
- **Edit**: Click "Edit" to modify service details
- **Delete**: Click "Delete" to remove a service
- **Statistics**: View total costs, provider breakdown, etc.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/adsl` | ADSL management page |
| POST | `/adsl/factures` | Create new ADSL service |
| PUT | `/adsl/factures/{id}` | Update ADSL service |
| DELETE | `/adsl/factures/{id}` | Delete ADSL service |
| GET | `/adsl/provider/{provider}` | View services by provider |
| GET | `/adsl/statistics` | Get ADSL statistics |

## Database Relationships

```
numeros (NDappel) ←→ factures (ADSL data)
```

- Each `NDappel` can be linked to an ADSL facture
- ADSL factures are identified by `is_adsl = true`
- Regular factures have `is_adsl = false`

## Model Methods

### Facture Model
```php
// Scopes
Facture::adsl()           // Get only ADSL factures
Facture::nonAdsl()        // Get only non-ADSL factures

// Methods
$facture->isAdslService()     // Check if ADSL service
$facture->getAdslTotalCost()  // Calculate total cost
```

## Statistics Available

- **Total ADSL Services**: Count of all ADSL factures
- **Total Monthly Cost**: Sum of all monthly costs
- **Providers**: List of all service providers
- **Average Monthly Cost**: Average cost per service
- **Provider Breakdown**: Cost analysis by provider

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simple Architecture**: No complex table relationships
2. **Easy Maintenance**: All billing data in one place
3. **Flexible**: Easy to add more service types
4. **Performance**: No joins needed for basic operations
5. **Consistent**: Works with existing `numeros` ↔ `factures` relationship
6. **Algerian Context**: Optimized for Algerian providers (Algerie Telecom and Mobilis) with DA currency

## Future Enhancements

- Add more Algerian provider service types (Mobile, TV, etc.)
- Implement billing cycles and payment tracking in DA
- Add export functionality (PDF, Excel)
- Create detailed reporting dashboard
- Add service status tracking (Active, Suspended, Cancelled)
- Add Algerian tax calculations
- Integrate with Algerian provider billing systems

## Testing

To test the ADSL functionality:

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. **Access the ADSL page**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/adsl`

3. **Create a test ADSL service**:
   - Use any existing NDappel from your numeros table
   - Fill in the form with test data

4. **Verify the functionality**:
   - Check that the service appears in the table
   - Verify statistics are updated
   - Test edit and delete operations

## Support

If you encounter any issues or need modifications:

1. Check the Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Verify database migration ran successfully
3. Ensure all routes are properly registered
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

The ADSL functionality is now fully integrated and ready to use! 🚀
